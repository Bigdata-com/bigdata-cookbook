    "# **Top Trending Topics for Crude Oil**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook implements an **agentic workflow** based on the content retrieval from BigData API to **identify, verifiy, reindex, and summarize** the specialized news that are **trending topics** for the crude oil market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1- Generation of the Lexicon**: Identify the specialized industry-specific jargon relevant to the crude oil market to ensure a high recall in the content retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2- Content Retrieval Based on BigData**: Perform a keyword search on the news content with the Bigdata API to retrieve documents, splitting the search over daily timeframes and multi-threading the content search on the individual keywords for speed purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3- Topic Clustering and Selection**: Perform topic modelling using a large language model to verify and cluster the news. Then, the summarization ensures topic selection identifying the top trending news for crude oil, while deriving advanced analytics to quantify the trendiness (based on news volume), novelty (based on daily changes in summaries), impact and magnitude (based on the financial materiality on crude oil prices) of the trending topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4- Customized Report Generation**: Customize the ranking system of the summarized topics based on their trendiness, novelty, and financial materiality on crude oil prices, and display a daily market update. For verification purpose, the reports are supported by the granular news and sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Daily Market Reports**: A detailed and visually appealing report summarizing the top trending topics for crude oil, with a customizable ranking system to reindex the news.\n",
    "2. **Actionable Dataframe**: A timestamped dataframe containing the granular news clustered into relevant topics, and the advanced analytics of trendiness, novelty, impact, and magnitude scores to be potentially used for backtesting purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Credentials for the Bigdata API to perform keyword and document searches on news content.\n",
    "- Credentials for the OpenAI API used in the notebook, this could be substituted with any other LLM.\n",
    "- A `tools` folder in the same directory as this notebook, containing a Python file named `utils_reports.py` with all required functionalities.\n",
    "- A `requirements.txt` file listing all the necessary Python libraries and dependencies. We recommend installing these packages in a virtual environment."

    "    1. **Focus on relevance:** Include only the most important and commonly used keywords that are uniquely tied to main theme and its market. These should reflect key concepts, market mechanisms, pricing benchmarks, logistical aspects, and industry-specific terminology.\n",
    "    2. **Avoid redundancy:** Do not repeat the word of the main theme or its components, such as \"Crude\" or \"Oil\" in multiple phrases. Include the main theme only as a standalone term, and focus on other specific terms without redundant repetition.\n",
    "    3. **Strict exclusion of generic terms:** Exclude any terms that are generic or broadly used in other markets, such as \"Arbitrage,\" \"Hedge,\" \"Liquidity,\" \"Spot Price,\" \"Futures Contract,\" \"Backwardation,\" or \"Contango,\" even if they have a specific meaning in the main theme market. Only include terms that are uniquely relevant to the main theme market and cannot be applied broadly.\n",
    "    4. **Include specific variations:** Where applicable, provide both the full form and common abbreviations as SEPARATE keywords (e.g., \"West Texas Intermediate\" and \"WTI\" or variations like \"Brent\" and \"Brent Crude\").\n",
    "    5. **Ensure clarity:** Each keyword should be concise, clear, and directly relevant to the main theme's market, avoiding any ambiguity.\n",
    "    6. **Select only the most critical:** There is no need to reach a specific number of keywords. Focus solely on the most crucial terms without padding the list. If fewer keywords meet the criteria, that is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The output should be a lexicon of only the most critical and uniquely relevant keywords related to the main theme market, formatted as a JSON list.\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">The oil sector is currently experiencing significant corporate developments, particularly highlighted by contrasting situations in Venezuela and Chevron Corporation. Venezuela's crude oil production is severely hindered by an aging refining infrastructure, frequent outages, and the impact of U.S. sanctions that limit the import of essential spare parts. This has resulted in a decline in production capacity, which is critical for the country's economy that heavily relies on oil exports. In contrast, Chevron Corporation is strategically enhancing its oil production capabilities in the Gulf of America (GOA) with new projects like Ballymore and Whale, aiming to increase output to 300,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2026. This growth is supported by advanced technologies and operational efficiencies that not only boost production but also align with global sustainability goals. The successful implementation of these initiatives is vital for Chevron to maintain its competitive position in the evolving oil market and meet rising global energy demands.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">U.S. crude oil imports and strategic decisions are currently influenced by a complex interplay of geopolitical tensions and market dynamics. Recently, U.S. crude prices surged by approximately 10%, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions, particularly from Iran, which could lead to inflationary pressures in oil-importing countries. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has ramped up its crude oil exports to 6.66 million barrels per day, reflecting its capacity to stabilize global oil prices amid these uncertainties. In a significant shift, India has become the largest importer of Russian crude oil, surpassing traditional Middle Eastern suppliers, which indicates a strategic pivot in global oil supply chains. Concurrently, U.S. crude oil production has reached an all-time high of 13.5 million barrels per day, primarily driven by the Permian Basin, providing a buffer against potential supply disruptions. However, U.S. crude inventories remain below the seasonal five-year average, suggesting a tightening supply situation that could exert upward pressure on prices if demand continues to rise. This evolving landscape underscores the interconnectedness of U.S. crude oil imports, production strategies, and global market stability.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">Geopolitical tensions, particularly involving Iran and Israel, have significantly impacted global oil supply and prices. The Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for approximately 20% of the world's oil, has become a focal point of concern due to Iranian threats to close it amidst escalating military actions. Such a closure could lead to immediate spikes in oil prices, affecting countries heavily reliant on Middle Eastern oil, like India and Japan. Recent military actions by the U.S. against Iranian targets have further heightened market volatility, with oil prices experiencing sharp fluctuations in response to these developments. While a full blockade of the Strait is deemed unlikely due to severe repercussions for Iran's economy, the mere threat has already influenced market dynamics. Additionally, companies like Civitas are facing operational challenges, including a production peak and financial instability, which could further complicate supply scenarios. Analysts predict a decline in Brent crude prices in the coming years, driven by increased production outside OPEC+ and moderated demand growth, but any unexpected geopolitical events could disrupt these forecasts. The interplay between geopolitical stability and oil supply dynamics remains crucial for market participants, as tensions can rapidly alter supply expectations and investor sentiment.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">The dynamics of US oil production and the global market are significantly influenced by geopolitical events, particularly tensions in the Middle East. Recent military actions, including US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, have led to immediate spikes in crude oil prices, reflecting market fears of supply disruptions. As of now, oil prices have risen to between \\$73-76 per barrel, with analysts warning that escalating tensions could push prices beyond \\$100 per barrel. The conflict involving Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, raises concerns over the stability of oil supply through critical chokepoints like the Strait of Hormuz. In response to these geopolitical shifts, India has strategically increased its reliance on Russian crude oil imports, which have become more attractive due to significant discounts from Western sanctions. This pivot highlights India's efforts to secure oil supplies amidst potential disruptions from the Middle East. Additionally, the US's enhanced domestic oil production capabilities have lessened its dependence on Persian Gulf oil, moderating the impact of geopolitical tensions on the market. However, the interconnectedness of military actions and oil prices remains a critical factor, as any sudden drop in Iranian oil exports could lead to significant price increases, underscoring the sensitivity of the global oil market to geopolitical events.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">The geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran pose significant risks to global oil supply, particularly affecting countries like China that depend on Middle Eastern crude oil imports. The Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil transit route, faces threats from Iran, which could lead to severe supply disruptions and push oil prices above \\$100 per barrel if conflicts escalate. Concurrently, the U.S. refining landscape is evolving, with a trend towards fewer refineries operating at higher capacities, as reported by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). While the total number of refineries remains stable, operational capacity is expected to decline without efficiency improvements, exemplified by the idling of the CPI Operations refinery in New Jersey. The largest refiner, Marathon, plays a crucial role in understanding market dynamics, as the U.S. seeks to balance its self-sufficiency in oil production through fracking amidst these environmental and policy challenges.</p>\n",
