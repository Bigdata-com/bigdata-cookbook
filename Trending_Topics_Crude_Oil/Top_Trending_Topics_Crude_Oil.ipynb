    "# **Top Trending Topics for Crude Oil**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook implements an **agentic workflow** based on the content retrieval from BigData API to **identify, verifiy, reindex, and summarize** the specialized news that are **trending topics** for the crude oil market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1- Generation of the Lexicon**: Identify the specialized industry-specific jargon relevant to the crude oil market to ensure a high recall in the content retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2- Content Retrieval Based on BigData**: Perform a keyword search on the news content with the Bigdata API to retrieve documents, splitting the search over daily timeframes and multi-threading the content search on the individual keywords for speed purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3- Topic Clustering and Selection**: Perform topic modelling using a large language model to verify and cluster the news. Then, the summarization ensures topic selection identifying the top trending news for crude oil, while deriving advanced analytics to quantify the trendiness (based on news volume), novelty (based on daily changes in summaries), impact and magnitude (based on the financial materiality on crude oil prices) of the trending topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4- Customized Report Generation**: Customize the ranking system of the summarized topics based on their trendiness, novelty, and financial materiality on crude oil prices, and display a daily market update. For verification purpose, the reports are supported by the granular news and sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Daily Market Reports**: A detailed and visually appealing report summarizing the top trending topics for crude oil, with a customizable ranking system to reindex the news.\n",
    "2. **Actionable Dataframe**: A timestamped dataframe containing the granular news clustered into relevant topics, and the advanced analytics of trendiness, novelty, impact, and magnitude scores to be potentially used for backtesting purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Credentials for the Bigdata API to perform keyword and document searches on news content.\n",
    "- Credentials for the OpenAI API used in the notebook, this could be substituted with any other LLM.\n",
    "- A `tools` folder in the same directory as this notebook, containing a Python file named `utils_reports.py` with all required functionalities.\n",
    "- A `requirements.txt` file listing all the necessary Python libraries and dependencies. We recommend installing these packages in a virtual environment."

    "    2. **Avoid redundancy:** Do not repeat the word of the main theme or its components, such as \"Crude\" or \"Oil\" in multiple phrases. Include the main theme only as a standalone term, and focus on other specific terms without redundant repetition.\n",
    "    3. **Strict exclusion of generic terms:** Exclude any terms that are generic or broadly used in other markets, such as \"Arbitrage,\" \"Hedge,\" \"Liquidity,\" \"Spot Price,\" \"Futures Contract,\" \"Backwardation,\" or \"Contango,\" even if they have a specific meaning in the main theme market. Only include terms that are uniquely relevant to the main theme market and cannot be applied broadly.\n",
    "    4. **Include specific variations:** Where applicable, provide both the full form and common abbreviations as SEPARATE keywords (e.g., \"West Texas Intermediate\" and \"WTI\" or variations like \"Brent\" and \"Brent Crude\").\n",
    "    5. **Ensure clarity:** Each keyword should be concise, clear, and directly relevant to the main theme's market, avoiding any ambiguity.\n",
    "    6. **Select only the most critical:** There is no need to reach a specific number of keywords. Focus solely on the most crucial terms without padding the list. If fewer keywords meet the criteria, that is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The output should be a lexicon of only the most critical and uniquely relevant keywords related to the main theme market, formatted as a JSON list.\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">The geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran's threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical maritime corridor for global oil transport, highlight the intricate relationship between energy security and environmental regulations. This strait is vital for the transit of approximately 20% of the world's oil supply, making it essential for countries like Japan, India, and South Korea that heavily rely on oil imports from the Middle East. Disruptions in this route could lead to increased oil prices and economic strain, underscoring the fragility of global oil supply chains. While Iran's threats may be perceived as a strategic maneuver, they risk alienating key allies and jeopardizing its own economic interests, particularly with major markets like China. The situation illustrates the broader implications of geopolitical conflicts on crude oil markets and the urgent need for sustainable energy practices and regulations to mitigate the risks associated with such volatility.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">Turkey's increased imports of Urals crude are influenced by the dynamics of the global oil market, particularly the decisions made by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC's production quotas significantly affect crude oil prices, with reductions typically leading to higher prices due to tightened supply. Conversely, increased production can lower prices, impacting Turkey's import strategies. The complexities of OPEC's influence are further compounded by geopolitical tensions and the involvement of non-member countries like Russia, which is part of the OPEC+ alliance. As Turkey navigates these market fluctuations, understanding OPEC's role and the broader geopolitical landscape is essential for predicting future trends in its crude oil imports.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">Water scarcity in Iraq has become a critical issue, exacerbated by a combination of climate change, mismanagement of water resources, and geopolitical tensions in the region. The country faces significant challenges due to reduced river flows from the Tigris and Euphrates, primarily caused by upstream dam constructions in neighboring countries like Turkey and Iran. This situation has led to severe impacts on agriculture, drinking water availability, and overall public health. Additionally, Iraq's water infrastructure is in dire need of repair and modernization, further complicating efforts to address the crisis. The government has been urged to implement sustainable water management practices and engage in diplomatic negotiations with neighboring countries to secure water rights and ensure equitable distribution. Without immediate action, the ongoing water scarcity threatens to destabilize the region and exacerbate existing socio-economic challenges.</p>\n",
