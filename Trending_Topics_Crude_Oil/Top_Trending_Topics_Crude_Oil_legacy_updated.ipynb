    "# **Daily Top Trending Topics for Crude Oil**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook implements an **agentic workflow** based on the content retrieval from BigData API to **identify, verifiy, reindex, and summarize** the specialized news that are **trending topics** for the crude oil market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1- Generation of the Lexicon**: Identify the specialized industry-specific jargon relevant to the crude oil market to ensure a high recall in the content retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2- Content Retrieval Based on BigData**: Perform a keyword search on the news content with the Bigdata API to retrieve documents, splitting the search over daily timeframes and multi-threading the content search on the individual keywords for speed purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3- Topic Clustering and Selection**: Perform topic modelling using a large language model to verify and cluster the news. Then, the summarization ensures topic selection identifying the top trending news for crude oil, while deriving advanced analytics to quantify the trendiness (based on news volume), novelty (based on daily changes in summaries), impact and magnitude (based on the financial materiality on crude oil prices) of the trending topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4- Customized Report Generation**: Customize the ranking system of the summarized topics based on their trendiness, novelty, and financial materiality on crude oil prices, and display a daily market update. For verification purpose, the reports are supported by the granular news and sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Daily Market Reports**: A detailed and visually appealing report summarizing the top trending topics for crude oil, with a customizable ranking system to reindex the news.\n",
    "2. **Actionable Dataframe**: A timestamped dataframe containing the granular news clustered into relevant topics, and the advanced analytics of trendiness, novelty, impact, and magnitude scores to be potentially used for backtesting purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Credentials for the Bigdata API to perform keyword and document searches on news content.\n",
    "- Credentials for the OpenAI API used in the notebook, this could be substituted with any other LLM.\n",
    "- A `tools` folder in the same directory as this notebook, containing a Python file named `utils_reports.py` with all required functionalities.\n",
    "- A `requirements.txt` file listing all the necessary Python libraries and dependencies. We recommend installing these packages in a virtual environment."

This lexicon should include only the most essential keywords, phrases, and abbreviations that are directly associated with trading, analysis, logistics, and industry reporting related to the main theme.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Focus on relevance:** Include only the most important and commonly used keywords that are uniquely tied to main theme and its market. These should reflect key concepts, market mechanisms, pricing benchmarks, logistical aspects, and industry-specific terminology.\n",
    "    2. **Avoid redundancy:** Do not repeat the word of the main theme or its components, such as \"Crude\" or \"Oil\" in multiple phrases. Include the main theme only as a standalone term, and focus on other specific terms without redundant repetition.\n",
    "    3. **Strict exclusion of generic terms:** Exclude any terms that are generic or broadly used in other markets, such as \"Arbitrage,\" \"Hedge,\" \"Liquidity,\" \"Spot Price,\" \"Futures Contract,\" \"Backwardation,\" or \"Contango,\" even if they have a specific meaning in the main theme market. Only include terms that are uniquely relevant to the main theme market and cannot be applied broadly.\n",
    "    4. **Include specific variations:** Where applicable, provide both the full form and common abbreviations as SEPARATE keywords (e.g., \"West Texas Intermediate\" and \"WTI\" or variations like \"Brent\" and \"Brent Crude\").\n",
    "    5. **Ensure clarity:** Each keyword should be concise, clear, and directly relevant to the main theme's market, avoiding any ambiguity.\n",
    "    6. **Select only the most critical:** There is no need to reach a specific number of keywords. Focus solely on the most crucial terms without padding the list. If fewer keywords meet the criteria, that is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The output should be a lexicon of only the most critical and uniquely relevant keywords related to the main theme market, formatted as a JSON list.\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">The recent geopolitical tensions, particularly between Israel and Iran, have significantly impacted crude oil prices and market stability, highlighting the importance of technological innovations in oil recovery. As conflicts escalate, concerns about potential disruptions in oil supply routes, especially through the critical Strait of Hormuz, have led to increased volatility in oil prices. Innovations in oil recovery technologies are crucial for enhancing production efficiency and mitigating the risks associated with geopolitical instability. For instance, advancements in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques can help producers maximize output from existing fields, reducing reliance on new drilling in conflict-prone areas. Furthermore, the integration of digital technologies and data analytics in oil recovery processes can improve decision-making and operational efficiency, allowing companies to better navigate the uncertainties posed by geopolitical events. As the market reacts to these tensions, the role of technological innovations in ensuring a stable oil supply becomes increasingly vital, underscoring the interconnectedness of energy production and global security dynamics.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">Geopolitical tensions, particularly between Israel and Iran, have significantly impacted global oil prices, leading to notable volatility in the market. Recent developments, including military actions and threats to critical shipping routes like the Strait of Hormuz, have raised concerns about potential supply disruptions, causing fluctuations in crude oil futures by as much as \\$8. The situation has prompted OPEC+ to adjust oil output in an effort to stabilize the market amidst fears of shortages. Additionally, the U.S. has considered emergency measures, such as releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to mitigate price spikes. The interconnectedness of geopolitical events and oil supply strategies is evident, as conflicts in oil-producing regions can lead to immediate and far-reaching effects on global supply chains. The Asia Pacific region's growing demand for petrochemicals, driven by urbanization and industrialization, further complicates the landscape, as it is expected to account for a significant portion of global oil consumption. Refining operations in the U.S. are also facing challenges, with major companies reporting declines in margins and capacity utilization, which could influence crude oil prices. Overall, the ongoing geopolitical instability underscores the sensitivity of oil prices to international conflicts, making it crucial for investors and policymakers to monitor these developments closely.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">The impact of sanctions on oil markets is significantly shaped by the strategic decisions of OPEC+ in response to geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East. Recent increases in oil production by OPEC+, including a notable rise of 411,000 barrels per day, reflect a proactive approach to stabilize prices amidst fluctuating demand and potential supply disruptions due to conflicts, such as the Iran-Israel situation. The organization's production levels, which account for approximately 41% of global oil output, are crucial in determining market dynamics, influencing both supply and pricing. As Asian economies, particularly China and India, remain key consumers of crude oil, any shifts in their demand due to economic conditions or energy policies can further affect global oil prices. The interplay between OPEC+ production strategies and external geopolitical factors, including sanctions, underscores the organization's critical role in maintaining market balance and responding to external pressures. The ongoing adjustments by OPEC+ are essential for managing oil supply and mitigating the risks of oversupply, especially as the market anticipates future production policies amid rising global demand and geopolitical uncertainties.</p>\n",
