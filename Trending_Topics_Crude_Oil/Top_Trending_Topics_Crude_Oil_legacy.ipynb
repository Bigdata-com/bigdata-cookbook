    "# **Daily Top Trending Topics for Crude Oil**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook implements an **agentic workflow** based on the content retrieval from BigData API to **identify, verifiy, reindex, and summarize** the specialized news that are **trending topics** for the crude oil market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1- Generation of the Lexicon**: Identify the specialized industry-specific jargon relevant to the crude oil market to ensure a high recall in the content retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2- Content Retrieval Based on BigData**: Perform a keyword search on the news content with the Bigdata API to retrieve documents, splitting the search over daily timeframes and multi-threading the content search on the individual keywords for speed purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3- Topic Clustering and Selection**: Perform topic modelling using a large language model to verify and cluster the news. Then, the summarization ensures topic selection identifying the top trending news for crude oil, while deriving advanced analytics to quantify the trendiness (based on news volume), novelty (based on daily changes in summaries), impact and magnitude (based on the financial materiality on crude oil prices) of the trending topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4- Customized Report Generation**: Customize the ranking system of the summarized topics based on their trendiness, novelty, and financial materiality on crude oil prices, and display a daily market update. For verification purpose, the reports are supported by the granular news and sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Daily Market Reports**: A detailed and visually appealing report summarizing the top trending topics for crude oil, with a customizable ranking system to reindex the news.\n",
    "2. **Actionable Dataframe**: A timestamped dataframe containing the granular news clustered into relevant topics, and the advanced analytics of trendiness, novelty, impact, and magnitude scores to be potentially used for backtesting purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Credentials for the Bigdata API to perform keyword and document searches on news content.\n",
    "- Credentials for the OpenAI API used in the notebook, this could be substituted with any other LLM.\n",
    "- A `tools` folder in the same directory as this notebook, containing a Python file named `utils_reports.py` with all required functionalities.\n",
    "- A `requirements.txt` file listing all the necessary Python libraries and dependencies. We recommend installing these packages in a virtual environment."

This lexicon should include only the most essential keywords, phrases, and abbreviations that are directly associated with trading, analysis, logistics, and industry reporting related to the main theme.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Focus on relevance:** Include only the most important and commonly used keywords that are uniquely tied to main theme and its market. These should reflect key concepts, market mechanisms, pricing benchmarks, logistical aspects, and industry-specific terminology.\n",
    "    2. **Avoid redundancy:** Do not repeat the word of the main theme or its components, such as \"Crude\" or \"Oil\" in multiple phrases. Include the main theme only as a standalone term, and focus on other specific terms without redundant repetition.\n",
    "    3. **Strict exclusion of generic terms:** Exclude any terms that are generic or broadly used in other markets, such as \"Arbitrage,\" \"Hedge,\" \"Liquidity,\" \"Spot Price,\" \"Futures Contract,\" \"Backwardation,\" or \"Contango,\" even if they have a specific meaning in the main theme market. Only include terms that are uniquely relevant to the main theme market and cannot be applied broadly.\n",
    "    4. **Include specific variations:** Where applicable, provide both the full form and common abbreviations as SEPARATE keywords (e.g., \"West Texas Intermediate\" and \"WTI\" or variations like \"Brent\" and \"Brent Crude\").\n",
    "    5. **Ensure clarity:** Each keyword should be concise, clear, and directly relevant to the main theme's market, avoiding any ambiguity.\n",
    "    6. **Select only the most critical:** There is no need to reach a specific number of keywords. Focus solely on the most crucial terms without padding the list. If fewer keywords meet the criteria, that is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The output should be a lexicon of only the most critical and uniquely relevant keywords related to the main theme market, formatted as a JSON list.\n",

This incident, exacerbated by Typhoon Gaemi, poses a severe environmental threat and could potentially lead to the largest oil spill in Philippine history, affecting Manila Bay and its surrounding ecosystems. The Philippine Coast Guard is actively monitoring the situation and implementing containment measures to mitigate the spill's impact, which has already affected a two-nautical-mile area. The event underscores the vulnerabilities of maritime transport in adverse weather conditions and raises concerns about the ecological repercussions for marine life and local economies reliant on fishing and tourism. The challenges faced in managing this emergency highlight the need for improved regulatory measures and response strategies in the region to protect both the environment and public trust in maritime safety.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">Recent reports from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicate a significant decline in U.S. crude oil inventories, with a drop of 3.7 million barrels for the week ending July 19, marking the fourth consecutive week of unexpected reductions. Current inventory levels stand at 436.5 million barrels, approximately 5% below the five-year average for this time of year. This tightening supply situation, attributed to stronger demand and lower production levels, is likely to exert upward pressure on crude oil prices. Additionally, gasoline inventories fell by 5.572 million barrels, the largest drop since March, further emphasizing the dynamics of supply and demand in the market. Despite these bullish indicators, concerns about weakening demand, particularly from China, continue to create volatility in oil prices. Overall, the interplay between declining inventories and broader economic uncertainties highlights the complexities of the current oil market, where positive supply data can be countered by demand concerns.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">China's weak demand for oil has raised significant concerns regarding its economic performance and the implications for global oil markets. As the world's largest oil importer, China's disappointing growth figures, with a reported rate of only 4.7% in Q2 2024, have led to a decline in oil imports and refinery runs, signaling potential challenges for oil producers. The People's Bank of China's recent monetary policy adjustments, including a surprise rate cut, have not alleviated fears of an economic slowdown, further impacting market sentiment. This decline in demand has exerted downward pressure on global oil prices, with fluctuations in WTI and Brent crude benchmarks reflecting the volatility in response to changing demand dynamics. Analysts are particularly concerned about the implications for refiners, as margins are being squeezed and crack spreads have fallen to low levels, indicating a potential slowdown in the oil market. The interconnectedness of China's economic health and global oil prices underscores the critical role that China's demand plays in shaping market stability and pricing strategies for oil producers and investors alike.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">TotalEnergies has experienced a decline in its financial performance, reporting a second-quarter adjusted net income of \\$4.7 billion, down from \\$4.09 billion year-over-year. This decrease is attributed to lower refined product and gas sales, alongside a significant 37% drop in European refining margins, despite a 2% increase in Brent crude prices. The company's results reflect the ongoing volatility in the oil market, influenced by fluctuating prices, production levels, and broader market trends. TotalEnergies is actively pursuing a balanced transition strategy, investing in both traditional oil and gas operations and renewable energy initiatives, including a recent partnership with Air Products for green hydrogen delivery. As the company navigates these challenges, it anticipates stable hydrocarbon production levels for the upcoming quarter, highlighting the dual pressures of rising operational costs and declining margins in the evolving energy landscape.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">Recent internal OPEC+ documents indicate that member countries are struggling to adhere to production cut agreements, with a history of overproduction complicating compliance. Updated compensation plans aim to manage output levels effectively, which is essential for stabilizing crude oil prices. The decisions made by OPEC+ have significantly influenced global oil supply and pricing, as seen in the fluctuations of Brent crude oil prices, which averaged USD 82.0 per barrel in May 2024 due to weak fuel demand and increased U.S. inventories. However, prices rebounded in June following OPEC+'s announcement to extend output cuts, which are expected to stabilize prices and manage supply. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts an average price of USD 84 per barrel for 2024, highlighting the impact of these production strategies. Russia has reaffirmed its commitment to OPEC+ quotas, while Iraq has also pledged to adhere to its production target of 4 million barrels per day, emphasizing the importance of compliance among member nations. The upcoming OPEC+ meeting is anticipated to focus on maintaining oil price stability amidst fluctuating global demand and geopolitical tensions, underscoring the critical role of OPEC+ decisions in shaping the global oil market and energy security.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">Refinery margins are currently facing significant pressure, with crack spreads declining to low levels, indicating a potentially weak earnings season for refiners. This situation is exacerbated by low diesel demand in Europe, as highlighted by TotalEnergies, which has led to profits returning to more normal levels after a period of elevated margins due to disruptions in Russian oil exports. The combination of volatile crude prices and ongoing geopolitical tensions has created an uncertain market environment, prompting refiners to reassess their operational strategies. This interconnectedness of crude oil supply, refining capacity, and market demand underscores the necessity for refiners to adapt to changing conditions to maintain profitability. The decline in diesel demand is particularly concerning for European refiners, potentially leading to further adjustments in production strategies and operational efficiencies, which are critical for the financial health of refining companies and their future investment capabilities.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">Under the Biden administration, U.S. crude oil imports have seen a significant increase, averaging over 6.5 million barrels per day, which is approximately 12% higher than the 2020 average. This rise occurs despite the U.S. producing and exporting more crude oil than ever before. The trends in U.S. crude oil imports reflect the complexities of the global oil market, influenced by domestic production levels and international demand, and have important implications for U.S. energy policy and market stability.</p>\n",

The decline of the Brazilian real has made imports more costly, necessitating this price adjustment.

The recovery process involved a ship-to-ship transfer conducted between July 23-25, 2024, with the crude oil now on its way to the refinery, expected to arrive in September. This event highlights the logistical challenges and operational complexities within the oil supply chain, particularly in geopolitically sensitive regions. The successful recovery is vital for Tupras to maintain supply stability and reflects the ongoing dynamics in the oil market.</p>\n",
