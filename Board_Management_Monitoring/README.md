## Automated Board Management and Monitoring Analysis Tool

This project provides comprehensive board management and monitoring capabilities for corporate governance analysis. It's designed for governance professionals, board members, and investment analysts to systematically assess board effectiveness, composition, and governance practices.

## Features

- **Board composition analysis** and diversity assessment
- **Governance practice monitoring** and compliance tracking
- **Board effectiveness evaluation** and performance metrics
- **Automated governance reporting** and risk assessment

## Installation and Usage

### Option 1: Docker Installation

#### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system

#### Setup and Run with Docker

1. **Clone and navigate to the project**:
   ```bash
   cd "Board_Management_Monitoring"
   ```

2. **Set up credentials**:
   - Copy the example environment file:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit the `.env` file and add your credentials:
     ```
     BIGDATA_USERNAME=your_username
     BIGDATA_PASSWORD=your_password
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

3. **Build and run the Docker container**:
   ```bash
   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t board-management-monitoring .
   
   # Run the container
   docker run -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -e HOME=/app -p 8888:8888 --env-file .env -v "$(pwd)":/app board-management-monitoring
   ```

4. **Access JupyterLab**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8888`
   - Open `Board_Management_Monitoring.ipynb`
   - Follow the setup instructions in the notebook
   - Run cells sequentially to perform the analysis

### Option 2: Local Installation

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager

#### Setup and Run

1. **Install uv** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Clone and navigate to the project**:
   ```bash
   cd "Board_Management_Monitoring"
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   uv pip install jupyterlab
   ```

4. **Set up credentials**:
   - Copy the example environment file:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit the `.env` file and add your credentials:
     ```
     BIGDATA_USERNAME=your_username
     BIGDATA_PASSWORD=your_password
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

5. **Start JupyterLab**:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

6. **Open the notebook**:
   - When the server starts, it will display one or more access URLs in the terminal
   - Click on one of the provided URLs (or copy and paste it into your browser) to open JupyterLab
   - Open `Board_Management_Monitoring.ipynb`
   - Follow the setup instructions in the notebook
   - Run cells sequentially to perform the analysis
