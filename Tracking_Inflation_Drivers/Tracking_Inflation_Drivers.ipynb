    "   ## Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "   Understanding inflation dynamics requires systematic analysis of complex, interconnected factors across the economy. Manually tracking inflation drivers across thousands of news reports, economic data releases, and market commentaries is time-consuming and prone to human bias. As inflation remains a critical concern for policymakers, investors, and analysts, there's an urgent need for scalable, systematic approaches to monitor inflation themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ## What It Does\n",
    "\n",
    "   This workflow is a Macroeconomic Drivers Tracker that breaks down US Inflation into its main components and drivers, then analyzes detailed news reports to extract insights in a structured analytical report. Built for analysts, portfolio managers, and economic researchers, it transforms scattered economic narratives into structured intelligence about inflation dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "   The workflow combines **LLM-powered theme taxonomies**, **semantic content retrieval**, and **structured reporting methodologies** to deliver:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Automated theme breakdown** into specific inflation components and drivers\n",
    "   - **Systematic document analysis** using embeddings-based search and classification\n",
    "   - **Economic categorization** that turns narrative signals into structured insights\n",
    "   - **Comprehensive reporting** with analytical summaries for each inflation driver\n",
    "\n",
    "   ## A Real-World Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "   This cookbook demonstrates a complete inflation tracking workflow for **United States Inflation in 2025**, analyzing news coverage from January to February 2025 to identify key inflationary pressures, categorize their economic nature, and generate a professional analytical report."

    "   ### Why is this needed?\n",
    "   Interactive environments (Colab, Jupyter) already have an asyncio event loop running. When bigdata-research-tools makes async API calls (like to OpenAI), you'll get this error without nest_asyncio:\n",

       "        <p>In 2025, U.S. inflation is projected to remain elevated, with the Federal Reserve maintaining a cautious approach to interest rate cuts amid rising prices driven by tariffs and supply chain disruptions. Consumer sentiment has declined significantly, with expectations of a 4.3% increase in inflation over the next year, leading to shifts in spending habits towards essential goods. Additionally, wage growth is robust, but concerns persist that it may contribute to inflationary pressures if passed on to consumers. Energy and food prices are particularly volatile, exacerbated by tariffs and supply chain issues, further straining household budgets.</p>\n",
       "        \n",
       "        <h2>Cost-Push Factors</h2><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Government Fiscal Policies: Stimulus Packages.</strong> In a recent statement, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen acknowledged that the stimulus packages implemented during the Biden administration may have had a minor impact on inflation rates, attributing the majority of the price increases to supply-side issues stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic. This highlights the complex interplay between government fiscal policies and economic outcomes, particularly in the context of recovery efforts post-pandemic. Yellen's remarks underscore the ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness and consequences of fiscal stimulus measures in addressing economic challenges. </p><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Government Fiscal Policies: Taxation Policies.</strong> Between January and February 2025, significant discussions surrounding taxation policies and their implications for government fiscal policies emerged, particularly in the context of the incoming Trump administration. Key proposals include raising taxes on high earners, with plans to increase the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6% and taxing capital gains over \\$1 million as ordinary income, which could impact the debt-to-GDP ratio significantly. Additionally, the introduction of tariffs, viewed as a form of taxation, is expected to raise consumer prices, with estimates suggesting an additional \\$800 cost per American household in 2025, thereby squeezing consumer spending and potentially exacerbating inflation, which is projected to rise to 2.8% due to these policies. </p><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions: Global Trade Policies.</strong> Between January and February 2025, the U.S. government, under President Trump, announced significant tariffs on imports from key trading partners, including a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. These tariffs are projected to add approximately \\$640 billion to the cost of U.S. imports, with economists estimating that they could raise inflation rates by 2 to 4 percentage points, significantly impacting consumer prices and potentially leading to a decline in GDP for Canada and Mexico by up to 4%. The uncertainty surrounding these tariffs has prompted businesses to front-load imports, adjust supply chains, and consider domestic production to mitigate rising costs, while consumers are bracing for increased prices on essential goods, with estimates suggesting an additional annual cost of \\$2,600 to \\$7,600 per American family due to these trade policies. </p><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions: Logistics and Transportation Costs.</strong> Between January and February 2025, logistics and transportation costs have been significantly impacted by supply chain disruptions, primarily due to rising shipping rates and congestion at key ports. For instance, the cost of shipping a container from China to the U.S. West Coast surged by 217% over the past year, while trucking fees from Shenzhen's Fuyong logistics hub to Yantian Port increased from 1,000 yuan to over 2,500 yuan (\\$345), exacerbating profit margin pressures for exporters. Additionally, warehousing costs now account for 13% of total supply chain expenses, with last-mile delivery representing 41%, indicating a shift in cost dynamics as companies adapt to inflationary pressures and potential trade tariffs, which could further inflate prices for consumers and disrupt supply chains. </p><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Commodity Price Fluctuations: Food Prices.</strong> Between January and February 2025, food prices in the U.S. have been significantly impacted by various factors, including inflation, supply chain disruptions, and potential tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. Reports indicate that egg prices have surged, with forecasts suggesting a potential increase of up to 20% due to avian flu outbreaks, while beef prices rose by 5.5% in January, driven by tight production and strong consumer demand. Additionally, the weaker Canadian dollar and looming tariffs are expected to exacerbate food inflation, particularly for fresh produce, which is heavily reliant on imports, leading to a volatile pricing environment for consumers. </p><h2>Demand-Pull Factors</h2><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Consumer Demand Trends: Shifts in Consumer Preferences.</strong> In early 2025, consumer preferences are increasingly influenced by economic pressures, leading to a notable shift towards value-oriented spending. Reports indicate that consumers are prioritizing essential goods and affordable luxuries, with a significant 67% of Americans expressing concerns over rising prices due to tariffs, prompting changes in shopping habits. Additionally, the packaged food industry is grappling with a focus on value as inflation persists, while brands that offer healthier snack options are gaining traction, highlighting a broader trend of consumers moving away from traditional mass-market products in favor of more niche, health-conscious alternatives. </p><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Consumer Demand Trends: Post-Pandemic Spending.</strong> In early 2025, consumer spending trends indicate a significant rebound, with holiday spending returning to pre-pandemic levels, as highlighted by NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz. The travel sector is experiencing a surge, with TSA throughput increasing by 7% year-over-year during the holiday season, driven by a 40% rise in holiday budgets among travelers and a growing trend of remote work while traveling. However, inflationary pressures are impacting consumer behavior, as evidenced by a dip in sales at fast-food chains like McDonald's, where menu prices have risen by an average of 27.2% since February 2020, leading to a shift towards home dining amidst rising costs. </p><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Inflation Expectations: Consumer Sentiment.</strong> Consumer sentiment in the U.S. has shown significant volatility in early 2025, particularly in relation to inflation expectations. Reports indicate a sharp decline in consumer confidence, with the LSEG/Ipsos Primary Consumer Sentiment Index dropping 3.2 points to 54.4 in January, and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index falling to a three-month low of 71.1. Inflation expectations have surged, with consumers anticipating a 4.3% increase over the next year, the highest since November 2023, driven by concerns over tariffs and rising costs of living, which have led to a notable shift in spending habits, especially among upper-income consumers whose spending intentions fell by 10.8 points in January. This decline in confidence and rising inflation expectations may signal broader economic challenges ahead, as consumers express worries about job security and financial stability. </p><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Inflation Expectations: Business Investment Decisions.</strong> In January 2025, U.S. orders for manufactured capital goods saw a significant increase, exceeding projections despite challenges such as a Boeing strike, indicating a potential rise in business investment as the economy enters the new year. This uptick in orders suggests that businesses are beginning to invest more heavily, possibly in anticipation of favorable economic conditions and inflation expectations. Additionally, W. P. Carey has strategically shifted its investment focus towards properties with inflation-linked leases, investing \\$191 million in a diversified industrial and warehouse portfolio across the U.S. and Canada, which reflects a broader trend among businesses to hedge against inflation by securing assets that will appreciate in value alongside rising costs. </p><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Labor Market Dynamics: Employment Rates.</strong> In December 2024, the U.S. labor market demonstrated robust growth with the addition of 256,000 jobs, significantly surpassing forecasts, indicating a strong finish to the year. However, challenges remain as inflation control is crucial to sustain hiring momentum and prevent layoffs. Moving into 2025, the labor market is expected to continue its recovery, with a projected increase in real wages due to declining inflation, which is anticipated to enhance consumer purchasing power and drive economic growth. Despite a slower job increase of 143,000 in January 2025, below the expected 175,000, the overall outlook for the labor market remains positive, with expectations of an expanding workforce amid cautious Federal Reserve policies. </p><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Commodity Price Fluctuations: Energy Prices.</strong> Between January and February 2025, energy prices have been a significant driver of inflation in the U.S., with a notable 3.5% surge in December attributed to rising petrol costs, which increased by 9.7%. The anticipated tariffs on oil imports from Canada and Mexico could further exacerbate this situation, potentially raising gasoline prices by 40 to 70 cents per gallon, with estimates suggesting an overall increase of up to \\$1 per gallon when combined with seasonal demand. Additionally, the rising electricity rates, now increasing at an annual rate of approximately 5%, are straining household budgets, with many Americans expecting to pay an average of \\$688 on energy bills during the winter months, highlighting the broader impact of energy price fluctuations on consumer finances. </p><h2>Monetary Policy Factors</h2><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Monetary Policy Adjustments: Interest Rate Changes.</strong> Between January and February 2025, the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy faced significant scrutiny as inflationary pressures and economic growth dynamics influenced interest rate expectations. Reports indicated that inflation remained elevated, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index rising by 2.6% year-over-year in December, prompting the Fed to maintain a cautious stance on rate cuts, with only one anticipated cut by mid-2025. Additionally, the impact of President Trump's policies, particularly tariffs, raised concerns about sustained inflation, leading analysts to predict that the Fed may keep interest rates higher for longer, thereby increasing borrowing costs and potentially dampening consumer spending and economic growth. </p><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Monetary Policy Adjustments: Quantitative Easing.</strong> In January 2025, the US M2 money supply reached \\$21.5 trillion, approaching its record high, which indicates a significant increase in liquidity within the economy. This expansion of the money supply is crucial as it typically supports risk assets, such as cryptocurrencies, which saw a 2.53% increase in market cap to \\$3.57 trillion. Despite the Federal Reserve's attempts to tighten monetary policy, the persistent growth in M2 suggests ongoing inflationary pressures that could influence consumer price index (CPI) trends. </p><h2>Wage Increases Factors</h2><p class=\"topic-summary\"><strong>Labor Market Dynamics: Wage Growth Trends.</strong> Between January and February 2025, wage growth trends in the U.S. labor market indicate a complex interplay between job creation and inflationary pressures. Reports show that average hourly wages rose by 0.3% month-over-month and 4% year-over-year, reflecting a robust job market with 256,000 jobs added in December and an unemployment rate of 4.1%. However, concerns persist regarding the sustainability of wage growth, as the Federal Reserve monitors these increases closely, fearing they may contribute to inflation if companies pass on higher labor costs to consumers. Notably, significant wage increases have been observed in specific sectors, such as a 62% wage hike for port workers over six years and Costco's phased wage increase to over \\$30 an hour for non-union employees, highlighting the ongoing demand for higher wages amid rising living costs. </p>\n",
