    "## Why It Matters\n",
    "In commodity markets like crude oil, timely awareness of trending news can directly influence trading strategies, hedging decisions, and market forecasts. As news cycles accelerate, being able to identify not just what is being talked about but also its potential market impact is essential for staying ahead of price-moving developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What It Does\n",
    "This workflow identifies, verifies, clusters, and summarizes the most relevant and impactful news trends in the crude oil market using the Bigdata API for retrieval and large language models for topic analysis. It produces both daily market reports and structured datasets that can be used for monitoring or backtesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "The notebook implements a four-step agentic workflow built on Bigdata API:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lexicon Generation** of industry-specific jargon to maximize recall in news retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content Retrieval** via the Bigdata API, splitting searches into daily windows and parallelizing keyword lookups for speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Topic Clustering & Selection** to verify, group, and summarize news into ranked trending topics, scoring each for trendiness, novelty, impact, and magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Report Generation** in the form of a daily digest with a configurable ranking system, supported by granular news sources for verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Real-World Use Case \n",
    "This cookbook illustrates the full workflow through a practical example: tracking daily stories in the crude oil market during the Israel-Iran tensions of June 2025. You'll learn how to transform unstructured news into structured, ranked insights on market-moving narratives.\n"

       "                    <p class=\"description\">The recent deployment of B-2 stealth bombers by the United States towards the Pacific, amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran, has significant implications for crude oil markets. Potential military action against Iran raises concerns about disruptions to oil supply, given Iran's status as a major oil producer. Analysts warn that threats to Iranian oil supply could lead to sharp increases in crude oil prices due to market reactions to supply risks. The U.S. military's involvement, particularly strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, has already caused notable spikes in oil prices, reflecting market anxiety over potential supply disruptions. However, as the situation evolves, prices have begun to stabilize, indicating that traders are assessing the likelihood of further military escalation against the actual impact on oil infrastructure. Despite military actions, reports suggest that Iran's nuclear capabilities remain largely intact, raising concerns about the future of its oil exports. The uncertainty surrounding U.S.-Iran relations and the potential for further military engagement could disrupt oil supply, affecting global prices. This dynamic underscores the interconnectedness of U.S. military actions and oil supply, highlighting how geopolitical instability drives market sentiment and pricing in the oil sector.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">The Strait of Hormuz is a crucial maritime chokepoint for global oil supply, with around 20% of the world's oil passing through it, including over 50% of China's energy supplies and 90% of Iran's crude oil exports to China. Recent geopolitical tensions, particularly between Iran and Israel, have raised concerns about potential disruptions to oil flows, prompting warnings from analysts like Goldman Sachs that a significant reduction in oil supply could lead to Brent crude prices spiking to \\$110 per barrel. The market is currently reflecting a 'war premium' due to the heightened risk of supply disruptions, which could result in major inflationary shocks and stall global economic growth. Additionally, increased military tensions have led to rising freight rates for oil transport, as shipping companies demand higher premiums for navigating the area safely. The Joint Maritime Information Centre (JMIC) has reported an elevated threat risk for shipping in the region, further complicating the stability of oil supply routes. The U.S. military presence in the area adds another layer of complexity to the geopolitical dynamics, influencing Iran's actions and the overall security of this vital supply route.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">OPEC+ plays a crucial role in shaping global oil supply and pricing dynamics through its production strategies, particularly in response to geopolitical tensions and market demands. Recent decisions by the group, which includes major oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Russia, to increase oil output‚Äîsuch as a rise of at least 411,000 barrels per day‚Äîreflect a strategic move to stabilize prices amidst uncertainties, particularly the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel. Industry leaders, including Rosneft's CEO Igor Sechin, have emphasized the importance of these production increases to mitigate potential supply disruptions and maintain market stability. OPEC+'s ability to manage production levels is vital, as their actions can either stabilize prices or contribute to volatility, especially in light of rising global demand and fluctuating economic conditions. The dynamics within OPEC+, including compliance issues and the influence of non-OPEC members, further complicate the landscape, making their production strategies a key factor for market participants monitoring crude oil prices and supply stability.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">In 2024, U.S. crude oil exports reached a record high of 8.6 quads, comprising 28% of total U.S. energy exports, driven by global demand influenced by geopolitical tensions and OPEC+ decisions. This surge enhances the U.S.'s position in the global oil market, affecting domestic pricing and production strategies, particularly for companies like Diamondback Energy in the Permian Basin. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a nearly 40,000 bpd increase in refinery crude oil processing capacity, although potential declines loom due to refinery closures. Additionally, the U.S. Geological Survey identified nearly 30 billion barrels of untapped oil reserves, primarily in Alaska and New Mexico, which could reshape global market dynamics if developed. Despite a slowdown in production due to natural depletion, the U.S. remains the world's largest oil producer, with advancements in extraction technology bolstering output. This production capacity insulates the U.S. economy from Middle Eastern conflicts and allows for flexible responses to international price changes, thereby influencing global oil supply and pricing strategies. Overall, ongoing developments in U.S. oil production are critical for both domestic energy security and international market stability.</p>\n",
