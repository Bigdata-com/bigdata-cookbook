    "# **Daily Top Trending Topics for Central Banks Announcements**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook implements an **agentic workflow** based on the content retrieval from BigData API to **identify, verifiy, reindex, and summarize** the specialized news that are **trending topics** for the Central Banks Announcements. \n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1- Generation of the Lexicon**: Identify the specialized industry-specific jargon relevant to the Central Banks Announcements to ensure a high recall in the content retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2- Content Retrieval Based on BigData**: Perform a keyword search on the news content with the Bigdata API to retrieve documents, splitting the search over daily timeframes and multi-threading the content search on the individual keywords for speed purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3- Topic Clustering and Selection**: Perform topic modelling using a large language model to verify and cluster the news. Then, the summarization ensures topic selection identifying the top trending news for Central Banks Announcements, while deriving advanced analytics to quantify the trendiness (based on news volume), novelty (based on daily changes in summaries), impact and magnitude (based on the impact on equity prices) of the trending topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4- Customized Report Generation**: Customize the ranking system of the summarized topics based on their trendiness, novelty, and impact on equity prices, and display a daily market update. For verification purpose, the reports are supported by the granular news and sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Daily Market Reports**: A detailed and visually appealing report summarizing the top trending topics for Central Banks Announcements, with a customizable ranking system to reindex the news.\n",
    "2. **Actionable Dataframe**: A timestamped dataframe containing the granular news clustered into relevant topics, and the advanced analytics of trendiness, novelty, impact, and magnitude scores to be potentially used for backtesting purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Credentials for the Bigdata API to perform keyword and document searches on news content.\n",
    "- Credentials for the OpenAI API used in the notebook, this could be substituted with any other LLM.\n",
    "- A `tools` folder in the same directory as this notebook, containing a Python file named `utils_reports.py` with all required functionalities.\n",
    "- A `requirements.txt` file listing all the necessary Python libraries and dependencies. We recommend installing these packages in a virtual environment."

    "    2. **Avoid redundancy:** Do not repeat the primary terms of the theme in multiple phrases. Include the main term (e.g., \"{main_theme}\") only as a standalone term, and focus on other specific terms without redundant repetition.\n",
    "    3. **Strict exclusion of generic terms:** Exclude any terms that are generic or broadly used across different fields, such as \"Arbitrage,\" \"Hedge,\" \"Liquidity,\" or \"Futures Contract,\" even if they have a specific meaning within the context of {main_theme}. Only include terms that are uniquely relevant to {main_theme} and cannot be applied broadly.\n",
    "    4. **Include specific variations:** Where applicable, provide both the full form and common abbreviations relevant to the {main_theme}. **Present the full term and its abbreviation as separate entries.** For example, instead of \"Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)\", list \"Zero Lower Bound\" and \"ZLB\" as separate keywords.\n",
    "    5. **Ensure clarity:** Each keyword should be concise, clear, and directly relevant to the {main_theme}, avoiding any ambiguity.\n",
    "    6. **Select only the most critical:** There is no need to reach a specific number of keywords. Focus solely on the most crucial terms without padding the list. If fewer keywords meet the criteria, that is acceptable.\n",

    "    The output should be a lexicon of only the most critical and uniquely relevant keywords related to the {main_theme}, formatted as a JSON list, with full terms and abbreviations listed separately.\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is expected to implement a 25-basis-point interest rate cut in its upcoming meeting, with a 99% probability of this decision. This anticipated cut follows a previous reduction earlier in 2025, bringing the cash rate down to 3.85%. The RBA's cautious approach is influenced by easing inflation pressures and a temporary pause in US-China trade tensions, despite lingering inflation risks. The central bank's forecasts for household consumption growth have been revised downwards, reflecting a more pessimistic outlook on the domestic economy amid global uncertainties, particularly related to U.S. trade policies. The RBA aims to stimulate economic growth while maintaining inflation within its target range of 2-3%, navigating the delicate balance between fostering labor market gains and controlling inflation.</p>\n",

The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has adjusted its growth forecasts and interest rate strategies in response to concerns over a potential global slowdown, largely driven by trade tensions initiated by the U.S. administration. Similarly, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has lowered interest rates, reflecting the broader context of global economic uncertainty and the adverse effects of U.S. tariff policies. These developments highlight the interconnectedness of domestic monetary policies with international economic dynamics, compelling central banks to carefully assess both local and global economic indicators. The prevailing uncertainty in international trade has led to a downgraded global growth outlook, prompting central banks like the RBA to adopt a cautious approach in their monetary policy decisions to maintain domestic economic stability amidst external pressures.</p>\n",

Analysts are concerned about a potential dovish shift by the BoE, which may arise from a slowdown in economic growth, impacting investor confidence and the GBP's performance. The BoE is evolving its communication strategy, moving from a singular forecast focus to a broader range of scenarios to enhance transparency and reflect the complexities of monetary policy. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to hold interest rates steady, citing improved exchange rate stability and a slowdown in fuel price increases, although internal debates persist regarding the need for rate cuts due to potential long-term economic damage from high rates. Chief economist Huw Pill advocates for a cautious approach to rate reductions, warning that rapid cuts could worsen inflation, especially with strong wage growth. This situation underscores the delicate balance the BoE must maintain between supporting economic growth and controlling inflation, making its future decisions critical for the economic outlook.</p>\n",

These developments are significant for both domestic investors and international markets, as they could influence Japan's economic outlook and currency strength.</p>\n",

This cautious sentiment among investors and analysts stems from a careful assessment of economic indicators and the Fed's prior communications. Additionally, the independence of the Federal Reserve is being scrutinized amid political pressures, notably from former President Trump, complicating the decision-making landscape.

Despite the Turkish central bank's implementation of aggressive interest rate hikes, confidence in the government's economic management remains low, contributing to the currency's continued decline. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has downgraded Turkey's growth forecast, attributing this adjustment to tighter monetary conditions and persistently high inflation.

       "                    <p class=\"description\">China's economic landscape is currently characterized by significant challenges, particularly in the banking sector, where lending has struggled to increase despite record-low interest rates. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) reported a 7.2% year-on-year growth in outstanding yuan-denominated loans, yet consumer loans, especially mortgages, have declined. This cautious lending environment is influenced by ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and other economic hurdles. In response, the PBOC has implemented a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio and cut the reverse repo rate, signaling a shift in monetary policy aimed at stimulating economic activity. These measures are designed to alleviate liquidity constraints and support growth amid global uncertainties. The positive market reaction, reflected in rising stock indices, highlights the significance of China's monetary policy decisions, which not only impact domestic economic conditions but also have far-reaching implications for global markets and influence central bank strategies worldwide.</p>\n",

With markets anticipating a nearly 90% chance of a rate cut in the near term, these adjustments reflect the ECB's strategy to support economic recovery while managing inflationary pressures.

The U.S. currently leads in this domain, but experts caution that this advantage may wane without timely innovation. The emergence of CBDCs signifies a transformative shift in monetary policy and financial systems, potentially disrupting traditional banking and payment frameworks. The Bank of Canada has been exploring the implementation of a CBDC since 2017, raising concerns about government oversight of financial transactions and the implications for individual privacy. Critics warn that a CBDC could facilitate increased surveillance and control, prompting ethical debates about the balance between digital currency benefits and personal freedoms. This evolving landscape underscores the urgency for the U.S. and other nations to navigate the competitive and ethical challenges posed by CBDCs to maintain economic leadership and protect individual rights.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">The recent downgrade of US government debt by Moody's and other major rating agencies has raised significant concerns regarding the stability of US fiscal policy and the associated risks for foreign investors holding US debt. This downgrade highlights underlying economic vulnerabilities and may lead to increased borrowing costs for the US government. Economists emphasize that inflation risks should be a primary focus when evaluating sovereign debt ratings, particularly given the rising foreign ownership of US debt, which diminishes political leverage. The implications of this downgrade are crucial for future Central Bank Announcements, as it could influence the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions.</p>\n",
