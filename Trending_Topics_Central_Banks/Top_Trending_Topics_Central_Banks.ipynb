    "## Why It Matters\n",
    "Central bank announcements can trigger significant movements in currency, bond, and equity markets. Timely identification of emerging narratives around monetary policy, rate decisions, and economic outlooks is critical for traders, analysts, and policymakers seeking to anticipate market reactions and adjust strategies accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What It Does\n",
    "This workflow identifies, verifies, clusters, and summarizes the most relevant and impactful news trends related to central bank announcements. It uses the Bigdata API for content retrieval and large language models for topic analysis, producing daily market reports and structured datasets for monitoring or backtesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "The notebook implements a four-step agentic workflow built on Bigdata API:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lexicon Generation** of monetary policy and central bank‚Äìspecific terminology to maximize recall in news retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content Retrieval** via the Bigdata API, splitting searches into daily windows and parallelizing keyword lookups for speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Topic Clustering & Selection** to verify, group, and summarize news into ranked trending topics, scoring each for trendiness, novelty, impact, and magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Report Generation** in the form of a daily digest with a configurable ranking system, supported by granular news sources for verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Real-World Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook illustrates the full workflow through a practical example: tracking top trending topics in central bank communications during the week of the ECB Forum in Sintra, when remarks from Donald Trump on Federal Reserve monetary policy coincided with high-profile speeches from global central bankers. You'll learn how to transform unstructured policy-related news into structured, ranked insights on market-moving announcements."

       "                    <p class=\"description\">Central Bank interest rate policies, particularly those of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), are significantly influenced by economic indicators, political pressures, and external factors such as tariffs. The Fed's decisions are shaped by labor market data, inflation expectations, and comments from political figures, including former President Trump, who has criticized the Fed for not lowering rates. Recent economic data, including a robust jobs report, has reduced the likelihood of immediate rate cuts, with markets pricing in only a 21% chance of a cut at the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated a cautious approach, emphasizing the need to assess the impact of tariffs on inflation before making any decisions. The RBA's interest rate adjustments aim to maintain a stable inflation rate and influence the Australian Dollar (AUD), with high rates supporting the currency. Overall, the interplay between economic conditions, political influence, and central bank policies remains critical in shaping monetary policy and its implications for economic growth and market dynamics.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">The Bank of England (BoE), under Governor Andrew Bailey, is navigating a complex economic landscape characterized by signs of softening in the UK economy and labor market. Bailey emphasized the importance of maintaining vigilance to achieve the inflation target of 2%, especially in light of recent declines in energy prices due to geopolitical events. However, uncertainties surrounding global economic conditions and domestic investment decisions raise concerns that further tightening of monetary policy could be counterproductive. The BoE is considering potential shifts in its monetary policy, including adjustments to its bond portfolio and interest rates, as it responds to inflationary pressures exacerbated by geopolitical developments. Additionally, there is increasing political pressure on central banks regarding interest rate decisions, reminiscent of past instances where such interventions undermined central bank independence. Policymaker Alan Taylor highlighted that the current monetary policy remains restrictive, indicating a cautious approach to rate cuts to avoid falling below inflation targets and increasing economic slack. Overall, the BoE's strategy reflects a careful balance between controlling inflation and fostering economic growth amid prevailing uncertainties.</p>\n",

This trend reflects the RBI's commitment to enhancing liquidity and stimulating economic activity, especially in the aftermath of the pandemic. Key measures include a reduction in the repo rate and the cash reserve ratio (CRR), alongside ongoing open market operations aimed at injecting funds into the banking system. Additionally, the RBI is reviewing its inflation targeting framework, which has been in place since 2016, with a focus on food inflation as a critical component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This review is expected to influence monetary policy decisions for the next five years. The RBI's proactive management of system liquidity, including repo auctions, is designed to facilitate smoother transmission of policy changes and support economic growth amid global trade uncertainties. Overall, the RBI's strategies are crucial for stabilizing the financial system and guiding market expectations in a challenging economic environment.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is navigating a complex economic landscape as it approaches its policy meeting on July 30-31, with Governor Kazuo Ueda's comments significantly influencing market expectations. Recent improvements in business sentiment among large manufacturers may impact discussions on potential interest rate hikes, yet the BoJ remains cautious due to persistent inflation above its 2% target and external pressures, particularly from U.S. tariffs. The recent appointment of board member Kazuyuki Masu, who advocates for a careful approach to monetary policy, adds to the evolving dynamics within the BoJ. The central bank's focus on data-driven indicators, such as wage growth and inflation expectations, underscores its commitment to maintaining economic stability amid global trade tensions and domestic challenges. The BoJ's decision to pause its monetary policy normalization reflects the ongoing struggle to stimulate growth, particularly as private consumption remains a key GDP driver. Overall, the BoJ's cautious stance is critical for shaping market sentiment and influencing the Japanese Yen, as it balances the need for policy adjustments against economic uncertainties.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">Geopolitical tensions, particularly those affecting oil supply routes, are significant drivers of inflationary pressures in the eurozone. KfW Research economist Stephanie Schoenwald noted that while oil prices have recently decreased, the potential for future increases remains a concern. European Central Bank (ECB) Vice President Luis de Guindos emphasized that rising oil prices could initially elevate inflation but may ultimately hinder economic activity, creating a complex relationship between inflation and growth. This uncertainty complicates the ECB's interest rate decisions, as it must navigate the risks of inflation against the necessity of supporting economic growth. ECB President Christine Lagarde warned of potential oil price spikes due to disruptions in critical areas like the Strait of Hormuz, which could exacerbate inflationary pressures and hinder the ECB's ability to implement monetary easing. Overall, geopolitical tensions present significant risks to inflation and monetary policy in Europe, necessitating a careful balance by central banks amid external shocks.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">The legitimacy of central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, is increasingly challenged by political pressures, notably from figures like President Trump, which raises concerns about the independence of monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stressed that the central bank's effectiveness in controlling inflation and ensuring financial stability is vital for maintaining its mandate. However, public demands for rate cuts complicate this relationship, highlighting the tension between political influence and the autonomy necessary for independent monetary policy. This balance is essential for sustaining trust and achieving economic stability.</p>\n",

The Norges Bank has acknowledged the uncertainty brought about by trade conflicts and tariff increases, yet the direct effects on Norway's economic growth seem limited. The central bank's cautious approach is reflected in its policy rate forecast, which anticipates a slight decrease in the near term, followed by stability in the long run. This perspective on inflation is crucial for guiding the central bank's decisions on interest rates and monetary policy, as it seeks to uphold price stability in the face of external challenges.</p>\n",

       "                    <p class=\"description\">China's economic landscape is currently marked by significant challenges, including a faltering post-pandemic recovery, concerns over deflation, and insufficient domestic demand. In response, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has adopted a cautious approach to monetary policy, as evidenced by its recent quarterly policy statement that refrained from indicating any intentions to cut interest rates or lower the reserve requirement ratio. This cautious stance reflects the PBoC's concerns about economic stability amid mixed manufacturing data and diverging PMI results. The central bank is actively managing its monetary policy to ensure price stability and promote growth, utilizing tools such as the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) to influence borrowing costs. Additionally, the PBoC is seeking guidance from European financial institutions on navigating low interest rates, highlighting its focus on financial reforms and a broader set of monetary policy instruments compared to Western counterparts. The PBoC's decisions will be pivotal in shaping both domestic economic conditions and global market expectations, particularly in light of external pressures facing the Chinese economy.</p>\n",
